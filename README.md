## BLACKJACK GAME

### [Live Site](https://blackjack-game-1.netlify.app/)

This is a basic Blackjack game that I built. The inspiration came from following a tutorial via Scrimba.

Functionalities:

I am use of the DOM, to get the element by id from the HTML file. I used "textContent" to grab the HTML element and make it interact with the JavaScript code.

I also make use of the reusable function technique, and the "onclick" event listener to be triggered when the button is clicked.

To select the two random cards at the start of the game and to select an extra card if the player is still eligible to continue with the game (that is, the total sum of all the cards is less than 21), I used Math.random() and Math.floor() functions to accomplish that.

And of course I used the if, else, and else if to check for conditionals. And also the boolean values.

I also used a "for" loop to loop through the cards.
